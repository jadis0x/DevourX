## Language Support
DevourX includes menu text in several languages:

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (`en-US`)
- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· Turkish (`tr-TR`)
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`)
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Korean (`ko-KR`)

The game asks for your preferred language the first time it runs. You can change it later from **Settings â†’ Language** in the menu or by editing `localization/config.json` and updating `localizationCulture`.

### Add another language
1. Copy `localization/en-US.json` (or the closest file) and rename it with your locale, for example `localization/es-ES.json`.
2. Translate the values, but leave the JSON keys and any placeholders like `%s` or `%d` unchanged.
3. Add your language name to the `languages` section at the top of the file so it shows up in the menu.
4. (Optional) Set it as default in `localization/config.json` while testing.

When you are done, send the new JSON file in a pull request.

## Uninstalling
1. Close Devour.
2. Delete the `version.dll`.
