## Language Support
DevourX ships with multi-language localization files. The in-game menu can be switched between:

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (`en-US`)
- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· Turkish (`tr-TR`)
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`)
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Korean (`ko-KR`)

By default, DevourX prompts you to pick a language on startup. You can change the language at any time from the **Settings â†’ Language** tab inside the menu or by editing `localization/config.json` (`localizationCulture`).

### Adding new languages
To contribute another language:

1. Duplicate `localization/en-US.json` (or whichever language is closest) and name the copy with your locale code, e.g. `localization/es-ES.json`.
2. Translate each string value while keeping the JSON keys intact. Values support standard ImGui formatting tokens such as `%s` and `%d`â€”leave those placeholders untouched so runtime substitutions keep working.
3. Update the `languages` map at the top of the file so DevourX can display your language name in the selection dropdown.
4. (Optional) Set your locale as the default by adjusting `localization/config.json` if you want to test it immediately.

Submit the updated JSON file(s) through a pull request.

## Uninstalling
1. Close Devour.
2. Delete the `version.dll`.
